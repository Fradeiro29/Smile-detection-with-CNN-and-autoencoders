# Smile detection with CNN and autoencoders
This repository contains an analysis and comparison of two neural network approaches—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Autoencoders—for classifying facial images into "smiling" and "not smiling." Includes preprocessing scripts, model architectures, training configurations, and experimental results, with a focus on edge computing applications.

The dataset used in this repository is contained in [smiles](smiles).
